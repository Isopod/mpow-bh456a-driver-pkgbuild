This repository is now **archived** because this apparently doesn't build anymore in more recent kernels. Could probably be fixed but I'm not interested, you'll have to try yourself.

Also, the source URL is no longer available, but someone appears to have uploaded the file to archive.org, if anyone wants to try their luck: https://archive.org/details/mpow_mpbh456ab_driverforlinux
